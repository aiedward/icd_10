## Introduction
Over one million patients visit Maharaj Nakhon Chiang Mai hospital at the outer patient department (reported in [2018](http://www.med.cmu.ac.th/hospital/medrec/2011/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=130&Itemid=589)). Every year, the hospital needs to report data to the government to claim for budget. 
### Problem statement
The amount of budget claim depends on the quality and completeness of the document. One major problem is the diagnosis (representing in ICD-10 code) has not been filled. The current process to fix this missing information is the medical coders review medical record and manually provide a proper diagnosis code which is impossible to complete on time. Therefore, we see a potential benefit to develop a system driven by machine learning model to automate the ICD-10 labelling process.
